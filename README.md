# Paintings-In-Thin-Air
A sketch based off of the current weather conditions via OpenWeatherMap API

<p>NOTE: <strong>Running this sketch requires you to have your own API key, which you can access by signing up for a free account. You can then copy the key into the setup portion of the sketch for the String variable "id".</strong></p>
<p>Based off of the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current#data">OpenWeatherMap data here.</a></p>
<p>Specific weather condition parameters are used to dictate how a system of particles change. For sole demonstration purposes, I used Los Angeles as the city, and imperial units. But the sketch can easily be modified to another city, or metric units. I'm looking to eventually have some way of setting input values for these on the start of the program.</p>
